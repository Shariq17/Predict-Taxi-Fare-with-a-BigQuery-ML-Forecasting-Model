# Predict-Taxi-Fare-with-a-BigQuery-ML-Forecasting-Model
BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage, or needing a database administrator.

BigQuery Machine Learning (BQML, product in beta) is a new feature in BigQuery where data analysts can create, train, evaluate, and predict with machine learning models with minimal coding.

Steps for this lab:

1)Use BigQuery to find public datasets.

2)Query and explore the public taxi cab dataset.

3)Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction.

4)Create a forecasting (linear regression) model in BQML.

5)Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model.
